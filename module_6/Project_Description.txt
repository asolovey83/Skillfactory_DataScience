Grocery and Gourmet Recommendation Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to build a recommendation model that will allow to increase the average 
bill in the online shop by recommending shoppers specific items.

We have the following dataset test.csv which we can use for making predictions. 
Each set of pairs userid - itemid has its own id, for which we should do a prediction.

The features were the following:

overall - rating set by the user
verified - was the review verified or not
reviewTime - the time when review was written
reviewerName - user name
reviewText - full review text
summary - summary of the review text
vote - a number of votes for the review
style - metadata
image - image of the product
userid - id of the user
itemid - id of the product
id - id for prediction

NickName on Kaggel is Andrew Solovey

I didn`t work in team, I did everything on my own. I guess I was good in analysing data and figureing out what item_features worked the best
